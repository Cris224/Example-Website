        <p>This website shows the skills I have aquired from the prework of the Flatiron Software Engineering Program.
            I will be putting together all of the skills I have learned in the CSS, HTML, and JavaScript languages.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>I will combine these skills to present some of my favorite video games of all time on this website.</p>
